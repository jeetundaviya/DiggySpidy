What They Say





















                                                    I was proud to see that CHARUSAT has the dream of becoming world class in education and reserach. This dream can be converted into reality, if we match this 'great ambition' with
                                                    'stimulating ambience'. I have no doubt that this dream will become a reality.

STUDENT'S TESTIMONIAL
















CHARUSAT helped me set a benchmark and gave me a head start towards my professional career. Faculties here have a student-centric approach while teaching. Industrial visits at regular intervals make the students well aware of recent trends and guide them accordingly to improve their learning graph.











Highly qualified faculty and flexible curriculum which offers a unique amalgam of technical and humanities courses along with the vibrant campus life helped us to become socially aware technologists prepared both for industrial and research domain and It's not only what you learn, it's how you learn.











I am thankful to CSPIT, IT placement team & Training and Placement Cell for inviting the renowned organizations and molding us as per the industrial requirements. Also they helped us in getting best profile and package of industry. I’m very much proud to be an alumni of such a beautiful college and be a part of the CHARUSAT family.”













Truly saying, Department of Information technology started aptitude classes which were very helpful for someone like me who had less knowledge of general aptitude. Also, motivational, Dos & Don’ts lectures were organized to make sure each student had enough confidence for appearing in placement & clearing It.











Highly qualified faculty and flexible curriculum which offers a unique amalgam of technical and humanities courses along with the vibrant campus life helped us to become socially aware technologists prepared both for industrial and research domain and It's not only what you learn, it's how you learn.











CHARUSAT has not only impacted me the best technical knowledge of my field but has also given me many opportunities to bring the best out of me as a developer.  However, I never had self-doubt, as CHARUSAT had implanted a strong foundation of technical, managerial and leadership skillsets within me.















CHARUSAT is one of the best institutions, not only of its infrastructure but also of its coaching, seminars and other activities. The Institution has motivated and given me every chance to explore my talents. CHARUSAT has got the best management, which supports the students in academics as well as personal life. 











CHARUSAT always focussed more on the development of the student as a personality, rather than just being a bookish engineer, & that's what I was always longing for. After joining here, I was never let down to my expectations from the University.

STUDENT'S TESTIMONIAL
















CHARUSAT helped me set a benchmark and gave me a head start towards my professional career. Faculties here have a student-centric approach while teaching. Industrial visits at regular intervals make the students well aware of recent trends and guide them accordingly to improve their learning graph.











Highly qualified faculty and flexible curriculum which offers a unique amalgam of technical and humanities courses along with the vibrant campus life helped us to become socially aware technologists prepared both for industrial and research domain and It's not only what you learn, it's how you learn.











I am thankful to CSPIT, IT placement team & Training and Placement Cell for inviting the renowned organizations and molding us as per the industrial requirements. Also they helped us in getting best profile and package of industry. I’m very much proud to be an alumni of such a beautiful college and be a part of the CHARUSAT family.”













Truly saying, Department of Information technology started aptitude classes which were very helpful for someone like me who had less knowledge of general aptitude. Also, motivational, Dos & Don’ts lectures were organized to make sure each student had enough confidence for appearing in placement & clearing It.











Highly qualified faculty and flexible curriculum which offers a unique amalgam of technical and humanities courses along with the vibrant campus life helped us to become socially aware technologists prepared both for industrial and research domain and It's not only what you learn, it's how you learn.











CHARUSAT has not only impacted me the best technical knowledge of my field but has also given me many opportunities to bring the best out of me as a developer.  However, I never had self-doubt, as CHARUSAT had implanted a strong foundation of technical, managerial and leadership skillsets within me.















CHARUSAT is one of the best institutions, not only of its infrastructure but also of its coaching, seminars and other activities. The Institution has motivated and given me every chance to explore my talents. CHARUSAT has got the best management, which supports the students in academics as well as personal life. 











CHARUSAT always focussed more on the development of the student as a personality, rather than just being a bookish engineer, & that's what I was always longing for. After joining here, I was never let down to my expectations from the University.
